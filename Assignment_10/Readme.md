I think it was a great toutorial. What I learned from it was mainly to use the melt function which was something that I was not familiar with. And Now I know how I can use it to extract information from columns and rows.

The other thing that I learned was to divide the problem into little elements to tackle the problem in an effective manner and  without getting overwhelm by the problem.

It also grat to review how to use other functions like split but in this case now in the context of a DataFrame. As I don't have a computer science degree and I appreciated the explination of all the elements of the functions as he was going through the problem. It made it easy to follow him along.
